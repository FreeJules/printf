.SH NAME
.B _printf
- behaves as printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <stdio.h>

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf is a function that produces output according to a format

.B Return value

Upon  successful  return,  this  function  returns  the  number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.B The conversion specifier

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.B b

The int argument is converted to binary notation.

.B d, i

The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.B o, u, x, X

The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.

.B c

The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

.B s

The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

.B S

The char * argument is converted to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

.B p

The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as if by %#x or %#lx).

.B r

The char * argument is converted to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string) printed in reverse.

.B R

The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string) printed in ROT13. ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet

.B %

A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
